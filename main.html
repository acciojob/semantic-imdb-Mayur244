			   <h2>Summary:</h2>
			   <p>The plot of Spider-Man 3 (2007) involves Peter Parker bonding with an alien black symbiote that gives him enhanced abilities but also brings out his dark side, leading him to become arrogant and aggressive. His relationship with Mary Jane suffers, and he clashes with a memory-wiped Harry Osborn, while also confronting two villains: Flint Marko, who becomes the Sandman, and Eddie Brock, who becomes Venom. Peter must ultimately overcome the symbiote's influence to defeat both villains and save his loved ones.</p>

				<p>For my character, I enjoy the turns that he gets to take. Harry is definitely villainous in this film, but he also has a point where he becomes the old, good Harry... I'm happy how the character goes out, I found it a strong point</p>
